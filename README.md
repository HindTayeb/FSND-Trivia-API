# Trivia-API

## Full Stack Trivia
This project is part of the Full-Stack Nanodegree program. With the follwing original description: 
Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out. 

The code base is done by Udacity and I only added and filled the required code and functions to make this work. 

## Files Structure
The project file has two parts: backend and frontend. Each have a README file that explains how to setup and run the project, and the tasks where I worked on. 

### backend
The ./backend directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. I worked mainly in __init__.py where I defined the endpoints and models.py for DB and SQLAlchemy setup.

### frontend
The ./frontend directory contains a complete React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. I updated the endpoints after defining them in the backend.
